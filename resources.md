1. [Ontology Flashcard #1: "What is a Project Ontology?".](https://youtu.be/5Lj76uJwL3c?si=LdcZzCKqeY3mKkrW)
- In summary, a Project Ontology is a structured data artifact that organizes and defines the relationships between concepts within a specific domain, enabling both humans and machines to better understand and process complex information. It serves as the foundation for building more efficient and intelligent knowledge-based systems. In upcoming episodes, we'll explore in greater detail how to develop these frameworks, identifying and defining key notions and concepts.

2. [Ontology Flashcard #2: "How is an Ontology Designed?".](https://youtu.be/pcAGVno_kYA?si=tqhHwV0RDs_aJkXw)
- In summary, Ontology Design - the art and science of constructing the blueprint of knowledge. The design of an ontology dictates how effectively it can organize and interpret complex information.

3. [Ontology Flashcard #3: "How do we use Ontologies?".](https://youtu.be/mmbdmo_GG48?si=27dzvWwxwp1cgiqY)
- In summary, this episode focuses on how these theoretical structures are brought to life in practical scenarios. We'll see how ontologies and their terms serve as the backbone for managing and interpreting complex data.

4. [Ontology Flashcard #4: "What is Semantic Entity Matching?".](https://youtu.be/ahgAFEyymBw?si=pUh8UDkn3ar9GXcK)
- In summary "semantic" refers to the meaning and interpretation of words and phrases in context. It's about understanding the deeper meanings and relationships beyond just the surface-level words. It is not just about linking data points; it's about understanding the deep-seated meanings and contexts behind these connections.
